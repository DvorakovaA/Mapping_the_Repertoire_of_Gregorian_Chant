(Mapování gregoriánského repertoáru)  
Anna Dvořáková, 2024

Attachment to the bachelor thesis.  
Subfolders:  
- `app` - folder contains everything needed to run a local application providing a tool for musicologists (see Chapters 5 and 6 for documentations)
- `data`- folder with data files (described in chapter 3)
- `research` - folder with jupyter notebooks that cover the research experiments in the thesis, see Chapter 4   
(to replicate the experiments, `research` folder must be placed next to the `data` folder)

The `thesis_requirements.txt` file contains Python libraries for both research and application. Each part has its requirements file in its directory that can be used for that particular part of the thesis.
