            <div class="container mt-1 mb-2">
              Big feature of this app is map visualisation that is driven by geography data (what is where). <br>
              To provide this we tried our best to find all provenances for our sources. But we did not manage to find them all 
              as well as we cannot have all possible places listed somewhere so if you upload new source from new provenance 
              app would be clueless about where to draw it. <br>
              For such situation there is geography page (reachable for example from <a href="#home">home page</a>), where you can help us 
              (as a logged in user) to identify unknown places. <br>
              <div class="container mt-1 mb-1 ml-4">

              </div>
              I section [1] there is space to identify same places written in different way (this can happened when someone indexing used different translation or add some punctuation etc.).<br>
              If there is no identity in provenance in bold on top and suggestions in section [1], then
              you can enter geographical coordinates in section [2]. Use decimal format of coordinates (e. g. [51.507222, -0.1275] is London).

            If your file does not contain any data from sources (liturgical books) unknown to this app, then uploading file containing chants would be enough,

          <h4 id="addgeo">Add geography info</h4>
          <div class="container mt-1 mb-3">
            Once you are asked to add some geography info about provenances you just uploaded in your dataset or you simply want to help us
            with identification of places then please visit geography page that can be easily reach from home page (via clicking the button under present map). <br>
            As is suggested in <a href="#geography">description of geography page</a> there are two ways of addition: <br>
            <div class="container mt-1 mb-3 ml-2">
              by matching unknown provenance with some already present in the database (preferred way)<br>
              by adding new coordinates (in decimal format, e. g. [51.507222, -0.1275] is London).
            </div>
          </div>

          <h4 id="cluster">Choose proper community search principle</h4>
          <div class="container mt-1 mb-3">
            That is difficult question. <br>
            ChantMapper app offer one deterministic (Complete agreement principle), one nondeterministic (Louvain algorithm) and one very experimental method (Topic models). <br>
            <div class="container mt-1 mb-1 ml-2">
              <b>Complete agreement principle</b> works on unification of same sets of chants - one way is treating all office as one big bag of chnats, other is 
              comparing chants in sets of office where two sources are considered being in same community while having all office sets same. <br>
            </div>
            <div class="container mt-1 mb-1 ml-2">
              <b>Louvain algorithm</b> is method for community detection in networks and is used e. g. for social networks. It optimizes the modularity of the network when merging its vertices in sequence. Paper is <a href=" https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1742-5468/2008/10/P10008">here</a>.
              It was used for purposes of chant by Eipert and Moss (link to their poster <a href="https://dlfm.web.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/dlfm/documents/media/poster2023_eipert_communities.pdf">here</a>).
            </div>
            <div class="container mt-1 mb-3 ml-2">
              <b>Topic modeling</b> is method borrowed from computer linguistic and NLP. We used LDA model (paper <a href=" https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2010/file/71f6278d140af599e06ad9bf1ba03cb0-Paper.pdf">here</a>).
              LDA is a hierarchical generative model of a text-like corpus, in which
              every document (here: source = liturgical book) is represented as a distribution over a number of topics, and every topic
              is represented as a distribution over all possible words (here: Cantus IDs).
            </div>
            So I would suggest to think about what you are searching for... 
            <div class="container mt-1 mb-2 ml-2">
              Is it overview of material grouped by same chants? Or are you user used to synoptic tables from Cantus Analysis Tool? <br>
              Go for Complete agreement principle. 
            </div>
            <div class="container mt-1 mb-2 ml-2">
              Is it possibility of new unseen connections with the risk of uncertainty? <br>
              Go for Louvain.
            </div>
            <div class="container mt-1 mb-2 ml-2">
              Is it interest in something completely new although it can lead to misleading results? <br>
              Go and try Louvain and also Topic model.
            </div>
