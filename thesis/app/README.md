## ## Mapping the Repertoire of Gregorian Chant - tool

The `Gregorian_chant_repertoire` folder contains an application programmed in the Django framework. It is a tool for musicologists to help them with exploring the results of a computational search for repertoire traditions within Gregorian chant.

The steps to run the application locally are given in Appendix A2. User documentation corresponds to Chapter 5, development to Chapter 6. Running the application is not dependent on the rest of this appendix.

In order to run the application, Python (version 3.11.6) as well as its libraries listed in `app_requirements.txt` file must be installed.
