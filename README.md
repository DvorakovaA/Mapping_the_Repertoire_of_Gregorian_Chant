## Mapping_the_Repertoire_of_Gregorian_Chant

Repository for development of my bachelor thesis at MFF UK. 

Directory `thesis` contains official attachment of my submitted work.  
  
Consists of three subdirectories:  
- `data` - with all data files
- `research` - jupyter noteboks with my research steps (uses csv files form `data`)
- `app` - django project with tool for musicologists (does not need any other files)
  

Other code is just experiments that were not used in the final result.  
Final thesis in pdf is also added.
